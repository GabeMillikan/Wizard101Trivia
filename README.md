# How to Install
1. Download python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ (it's the big yellow button). Python is the programming language used in this project.
2. Install it. You shouldn't have to change any options, just keep clicking next. 
3. Open a command prompt or terminal (it is important that you wait to open the terminal until AFTER step 2 is fully complete).

    - How to do it on MacOS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw7Nd67_aFw
    - If you're on Linux then you should already know how.
4. Copy/paste this into the terminal, press enter, and wait for it to complete. Only run the command for your operating system.
    - MacOS and Linux: `python -m pip install pyautogui`
    - Windows: `py -m pip install pyautogui`
5. Exact same as step 4, but this command:
    - MacOS and Linux: `python -m pip install pyperclip`
    - Windows: `py -m pip install pyperclip`
6. 
    - Here's a direct link to the code: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GabeMillikan/Wizard101Trivia/main/trivia.pyw
    - You may just right click and press "Save" once you're at the above link
    - Otherwise, create a file named "trivia.pyw" on your computer, then edit it with a text editor (ex: notepad) and copy/paste the whole code into it
    - Be careful to make sure that the file is called "trivia.pyw" and not "trivia.pyw.txt" or "trivia.pyw.py"
7. Double click the file, or open it with python (which was installed in step 2)
    - If the window does not open, or something does not work, feel free to message me.
