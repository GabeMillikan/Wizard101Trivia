# How to Download
1. Download python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ (it's the big yellow button). Python is the programming language used in this project.
2. Install it. You shouldn't have to change any options, just click "Install now". 
3. Open a command prompt or terminal (it is important that you wait to open the terminal until AFTER step 2 is fully complete).

    - How to do it on MacOS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw7Nd67_aFw
    - If you're on Linux then you should already know how.
4. Copy/paste this into the terminal, press enter, and wait for it to complete (you should see a lot of text scroll by). Don't worry if you see any yellow warnings, just ignore them. Only run the command for your operating system.
    - MacOS and Linux: `python -m pip install pyautogui`
    - Windows: `py -m pip install pyautogui
5. Exact same as step 4, but this command:
    - MacOS and Linux: `python -m pip install fuzzywuzzy`
    - Windows: `py -m pip install fuzzywuzzy`
6. Now you'll need to download this project itself. Follow these steps
    - Go to this link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GabeMillikan/Wizard101Trivia/main/trivia.pyw
    - Right click anywhere and choose "Save As" (or just press ctrl-s)
    - Save it to your computer as "trivia.pyw"
    - You can call it anything you want, it just has to end with ".pyw". A common mistake would be to accidentally call the file "trivia.pyw.txt", so if the program doesn't work, that is probably why.
7. Double click the file to run it. You might have to choose to open it with Python which was installed in step 2.
    - You should see the window at this point! If you don't, then something is wrong and feel free to message me.
